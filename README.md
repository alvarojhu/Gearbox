**Analytics.pdf** PDF version of the presentation. This can be viewed in the browser or downloaded.

\** for the presentation, there are a few additional analyses in the "Appendix" section. During my presentation, I would say these findings instead of going to the appendix, but since I am not presenting, you still need a way to read my conclusions.

  2.) **sessions.zip** contains sessions.csv. CSV file of all "context" entries in the "cleaned.jsonl" file provided.
